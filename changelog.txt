Heads up! - This version no longer supports 1.16.3. Your 1.16.3 mods will run in 1.16.4 and up, so please switch to using those versions.

Inferno
- Fireballs can be configured to explode (obviously disabled by default)
- More configuration to its attacks

Hunger
- Slightly altered animations
- Slightly increased hitbox size
- New hitbox detection method for items and entities (careful! - will now detect entities along its entire mouth instead of just the center)

Kraken
- Marginally increased hitbox size

Misc
- No longer officially supports 1.16.3, as newer Geckolib versions are needed for improvements and necessary bugfixes
